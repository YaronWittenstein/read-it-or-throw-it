1. [Elixir v1.7 released](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2018/07/25/elixir-v1-7-0-released/)

Six months have passed since the v1.6 and this release comes with many refinements.

I like the new IEx metadata printing!

  

  

2. [Tech Preview: Redis Enterprise 5.3 with Streams is here!](https://redislabs.com/blog/tech-preview-redis-enterprise-5-3-streams/)

RedisLabs Enterprise Edition has now Redis Streams as a preview version.

  

  

3. [In Pursuit of Production Minimalism](https://brandur.org/minimalism)

TL;DR - don't own a too broad technology stack just for the sake of being cool.

strive to be pragmatic and don't bloat your tech with too many new shiny tools that might not be useful.

What matters is a working production software that could evolve over time

  

I really liked and agreed with this article.

  

  

4. [Prometheus monitoring tool joins Kubernetes as CNCF’s latest ‘graduated’ project](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/09/prometheus-monitoring-tool-joins-kubernetes-as-cncfs-latest-graduated-project/)

5. [InfluxDB - Why We're Building Flux, a New Data Scripting and Query Language](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/why-were-building-flux-a-new-data-scripting-and-query-language/)

InfluxDB (you can say Prometheus competitor) started defining on a new query language

for its product 

  

  

6. [It's Okay To Store Data In Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/)

A good article of Confluent talking about an emerging pattern for having a single source of truth of the data backed by Kafka 

  

  

7. [You don’t need standup](https://medium.com/@jsonpify/you-dont-need-standup-9a74782517c1)

Honestly I agree with pretty much everything. Having a daily standup adds a lot of burden, gets almost always lengthy and instead of being an energy booster turns to be a fatigue increaser.

  

  

8. [Crates.io just passed RubyGems in number of new packages per day](https://twitter.com/jntrnr/status/1026285193462571008)

Another indication that Rust will be huge

  

  

9. [The Myth of 'I'm Bad at Math'](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/the-myth-of-im-bad-at-math/280914/)

Explain the strong relation between being good at math (but applies to other fields as well) and having the right guidance and mindset

  

  

10. [Grit: the power of passion and perseverance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H14bBuluwB8)

A short TED talk about the importance of having Grit for success
