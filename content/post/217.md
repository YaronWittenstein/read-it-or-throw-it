1. [Train Your Own Neural Network (gryphon.dev)](train-your-own-neural-network)
<br/>
I've written a blog post that rambles about different learning strategies 
that emphasize feeding our brains with many inputs. 

2. [Software and the IKEA Effect](software-ikea-effect)
<br/>
This piece is written by my co-worker Lane Rettig where he explains ...

3. [Announcing Tokio 1.0](tokio-1)
<br/>
This is a huge milestone not only for the Tokio project but for Rust in general.
Tokio is a very dominant in the Rust ecosystem and reaching the 1.0 milestone is
a huge step forward for Rust maturity. 


4. [Death of an Open Source Business Model](death-of-open-source-business-model)
<br/>
I really liked reading this article. The author argues that the era of Software companies
granting free access to their core is over in general.

The author gives examples for companies that have chosen to Open-Source their code under MIT or similar license - only to later to become closed source or
to adapt their license. 

I tend to agree with most of the content - their will always be exceptions but in general
companies needs to stay competitive and giving away free access to their core assets will in most cases
make it much harder.

5. [Adding BPF target support to the Rust compiler](rust-bpf-target)
<br/>
The eBPF is a Linux kernel enhancement that brings more advanced inspection and tracing
capabilities into the kernel and running applications.
<br/>
The eBPF is a new generation of the old BPF bytecode that has been used for dealing with network traffic.
<br/>
The BPF programs are deployed into the kernel and are written in an ad-hoc bytecode.
The are new initiatives to use Rust for writing tools that will output BPF programs instead of using a dedicated tool 
or writing plain C code (or mixing python with C snippets). 
<br/>
Generating BPF programs using some ergonomic Rust API has a very good potential.
It reminds me of the high involvement of Rust in the Wasm (WebAssembly).
Both Wasm and eBPF are still considered early-stage and it seems that Rust is trying to be dominant in both worlds.

6. [Isoflow - Create beautiful cloud diagrams in minutes](isoflow)
<br/>
A nice and free online tool I've found that makes it easy to draw architecture diagrams.
It's good to bookmark for future use.

7. [One year of Nushell](year-of-nushell)
<br/>
Another Rust project that gains traction is nushell. It a shell written purely in Rust with focus on
structured data in a way that resembles PowerShell. I'll keep tracking its progress and maybe in the future
when it'll become my default shell. 

8. [Taming the Mammoth: Why You Should Stop Caring What Other People Think](taming-mammoth)
<br/>
This is a classic article that details why most of use care about others think of us and suggests
how to mitigate such irrational thoughts and unproductive resulting actions that stem from them. 

9. [Recommended Book - Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones](atomic-habits-book)
<br/>
I consider this book one of the most influential books I've ever read.
It has tons of life wisdom tactics of how to form new habits and, more importantly, how to maintain them.
This book made me think a lot about the way I manage myself and where I can get better by forming new useful habits.
<br/>
After you read it - please take a look the [Hooked](hooked-book).
This book shares a lot of the ideas of the _Atomic Habits_ but in another context, of how to design products
that will make people use it habitually.
