9. [Recommended Book - Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones](atomic-habits-book)
<br/>
I consider this book one of the most influential books I've ever read.
It has tons of life wisdom tactics of how to form new habits and, more importantly, how to maintain them.
This book made me think a lot about the way I manage myself and where I can get better by forming new useful habits.
<br/>
After you read it - please take a look the [Hooked](hooked-book).
This book shares a lot of the ideas of the _Atomic Habits_ but in another context, of how to design products
that will make people use it habitually.
