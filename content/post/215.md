1. [][]

2. [Announcing the Bytecode Alliance: Building a secure by default, composable future for WebAssembly][bytecode-alliance]
<br/>

3. [Join the beta: our new serverless compute environment gives you more power at the edge][fastly-serverless-edge]
<br/>

4. [GitHub Universe 2019 TL;DR][github-universe-2019]
<br/>
A very good summary of the annual event of GitHub Universe. The biggest announcement is that GitHub Actions is now publicly available for everyone!

5. [Visual Studio Online - Cloud-powered dev environments accessible from anywhere][vscode-online]
<br/>
see also: [Gitpod][gitpod]

6. [Execute Program: Learn programming tools fast. Then remember them.][executeprogram]
<br/>
A new [Spaced repetition][spaced-repetition] based training for developers.
The training is organized by courses.  [Gary Bernhardt][garybernhardt-twitter] which is a very famous developer
known for being innovative.
It's a very new platform. It's only the beginning and new courses will be added. I'm curious to see how this will evolve.

7. [Conventional Commits][conventionalcommits]
<br/>
Did you notice people who use commit messages of patterns like:
`feat(...): new feature` or `fix: fixed the failed test...`
This is more than phenomenon, but a well defined git messages commit conventions.
I've started using it and I think it adds more hygiene to the code.

8. [Fourteen years after launching, 1Password takes a $200M Series A][1password-series-a]
<br/>
I've been using 1Password for a couple of years and I really think it's a good product. The company refines and makes the product better consistently.
It's an truly remarkable story of a self-funded company that raises such a  great amount of money of Series-A, 14 years after being founded.

9. [Recommended Talk: Rust's Journey to Async/Await][rust-async-await-talk]
<br/>
As always, Steve Klabnik condenses a lot of info (and history) elegantly and clearly into a great talk.
This time, the talk outlines the evolution of Rust Async until today. Steve explain trade-offs taken in Rust in order to reach the holy grail
of having zero-cost abstractions futures.
Rust async/await syntax became stable at the [1.39.0 release][rust-1.39.0].

10. [Recommended Book: The Pragmatic Programmer: your journey to mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)][pragmatic-programmer]
Pragmatic Programmer is a classic. One of the most cited as "Must Read for every Programmer book".
I've never read this book. Recently, the 2nd edition has been published and I thought it's about time I'll read the book.
Overall, I wish I'd read this book when I was at the start of my career. I think it would have helped me understand a lot of things faster, as opposed
to learn time by myself. I believe that experienced programmers could also benefit reading this book as it's a centralized piece covering many
aspects of a professional developer craft.
