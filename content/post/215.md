1. [2019 Summary][2019-summary]
<br/>
My post summarizing my 2019 professional year.
<br/>
**I've also added a [Subscribe page][subscribe] to my blog!**

2. [Announcing the Bytecode Alliance: Building a secure by default, composable future for WebAssembly][bytecode-alliance]
<br/>
This is a long read but a good one. The post starts with an announcement of a joint effort between leading companies that rely on WebAssembly to build the future
of the internet and outside-the-browser infrastructure (Mozilla, Fastly etc).
<br/>
Then the post proceeds with explanations on how using WebAssembly while employing a capabilities based security model built-in
will serve as a foundation to avoid much of the security vulnerabilities lurking almost each application nowadays.

3. [Join the beta: our new serverless compute environment gives you more power at the edge][fastly-serverless-edge]
<br/>
Fastly releases in Beta its new serverless platform named _Compute@Edge_ based on _Lucet_, their developed WebAssembly Runtime.
We can start feeling right now the future of the internet. A CDN provider will cease to be merely a dumb provider of cached content, but it will transform to hosting
full-blown applications. This is only the beginning, rest assured that more companies will enter this field. Not only traditional CDNs providers
such as Akamai but also Cloud providers like Amazon.
<br/>
<br/>
The boundaries between a Cloud to a CDN provider will become blurry. They will all run WebAssembly code and compete with one another for who will get the chance to run our code.
I predict that many databases, storage solutions and other services will be available on the Edge too like.
<br/>
<br/>
Add to above the new emerging QUIC as the next TCP and the Internet speed looks bright.

4. [GitHub Universe 2019 TL;DR][github-universe-2019]
<br/>
A very good summary of the annual event of GitHub Universe. The biggest announcement is that GitHub Actions is now publicly available for everyone!

5. [Visual Studio Online - Cloud-powered dev environments accessible from anywhere][vscode-online]
<br/>
Microsoft Release for a VSCode as a SaaS for public preview.
<br/>
It's hard to predict it'll catch or not but only time will tell.
<br/>

6. [Execute Program: Learn programming tools fast. Then remember them.][executeprogram]
<br/>
A new [Spaced repetition][spaced-repetition] based training for developers. The training is organized by courses.
The platform has been created by [Gary Bernhardt][garybernhardt-twitter] who is a very famous developer
known for being innovative.
It's a very new platform. It's only the first steps and new courses will be added. I'm curious to see how this will evolve.

7. [Conventional Commits][conventionalcommits]
<br/>
Did you notice people who use commit messages of patterns like:
`feat(...): new feature` or `fix: fixed the failed test...`
This is more than phenomenon, but a well defined git messages commit conventions.
I think it adds more hygiene to the code, and I'll consider using that too.

8. [Fourteen years after launching, 1Password takes a $200M Series A][1password-series-a]
<br/>
I've been using 1Password for a couple of years and I really think it's a good product. The company refines and makes the product better consistently.
It's a truly remarkable story of a self-funded company that raises such a  great amount of money for Series A - 14 years after have been founded!
<br/>
BTW, the 1Password team has [rewritten part of their browser extension code in Rust!][1password-with-rust] (compiled to WebAssembly that runs as part of the browser-extension).

9. [Recommended Talk: Rust's Journey to Async/Await][rust-async-await-talk]
<br/>
As always, Steve Klabnik condenses a lot of info (and history) elegantly and clearly into a great talk.
This time, the talk outlines the evolution of Rust Async until today.
<br/>
Steve explains the trade-offs taken in Rust in order to reach the holy grail
of having zero-cost abstractions futures.
<br/>
Rust async/await syntax became stable recently at the [1.39.0 release][rust-1.39.0].

10. [Recommended Book: The Pragmatic Programmer: your journey to mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)][pragmatic-programmer]
<br/>
Pragmatic Programmer is a classic. One of the most cited as "Must Read for every Programmer book".
I've never read this book. A few months ago, the 2nd edition has been published and I thought it's about time I'll read the book.
Overall, I wish I'd read this book when I was at the start of my career. I think it would have helped me understand a lot of things faster, as opposed
to learn them by nature. I believe that experienced programmers could also benefit reading this book as it's a centralized piece covering many
aspects of a professional developer craft.
