1. [Cloud Computing without Containers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloud-computing-without-containers)

CloudFlare leverages the V8 engine for their serverless (workers) infra.

This is a very promising strategy since the future will rely on WebAssembly and the end of the javascript as the only Frontend language

  

2. [Rust can be difficult to learn and frustrating, but it’s also the most exciting thing in software development in a long time](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/rust-can-be-difficult-to-learn-and-frustrating-but-its-also-the-most-exciting-thing-in-software-development-in-a-long-time/)

Paul Dix, Influxdata CEO gives his take about Rust (Influxdb is written in Go)

  

3. [HTTP/3](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/11/11/http-3/)

The usage of TCP in the browsers will be eventually superseded (gradually) by QUIC (reliable protocol on top of UDP) and the internet will be much faster thanks to that

  

4. [Why I Switched My Keyboard from QWERTY to Colemak. How to Type Faster with a More Efficient Keyboard Layout](https://www.tckpublishing.com/why-i-switched-my-keyboard-from-qwerty-to-colemak-how-to-type-faster-with-a-more-efficient-keyboard-layout/)

I'm now in the middle of learning a new keyboard layout called Colemak. So far it's been going well. I prefer Colemak over Dvorak since Colemak has fewer characters changes

  

5. [GitHub launches Actions, its workflow automation tool](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/github-launches-actions-its-workflow-automation-tool/)

Github wants to be a one-stop-shop for all the code management lifecycle too (the same vision as GitLab)

  

6. [Three 20-Year-Old Founders Raise $4.5M For Their Cloud-Powered IDE](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/three-20-year-old-founders-raise-4-5m-for-their-cloud-powered-ide/)

This is huge, not only because the founders are very young but because of the innovative concept of having an IDE backed by a super-computer power

  

7. [If you want to level up as an engineer, read the code. All of it](https://medium.com/@mrjoelkemp/a-single-action-that-will-level-you-up-as-a-software-engineer-d5cd2d0e4787)

I tend to agree with this article. However, anyone has a limit of how much code he/she can read. I think that reading all your territory and understand where it fits into the big picture is a huge productivity

  

8. [The fear of an empty source file - Ayende](https://ayende.com/blog/184993-A/the-fear-of-an-empty-source-file)

I really agree with this article. It's very hard to bootstrap a new project

and the more you know might make it even harder 

  

9. [RealtimeBoard, a visual collaboration platform for companies, raises $25M](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/realtimeboard/)

I loved the concept of this product

  

10. [Bad Writing Is Destroying Your Company’s Productivity](https://hbr.org/2016/09/bad-writing-is-destroying-your-companys-productivity)

I usually write my emails with numbered bullets in order to have order and clarify what I want to say
