1. [No, the problem isn’t “bad coders”](https://medium.com/@sgrif/no-the-problem-isnt-bad-coders-ed4347810270)

A well-written article talking about the importance of having programming languages that will guard us the developers from as many mistakes as possible.

  

After all, we're humans and humans make mistakes.

Also, projects assumptions change over time.

Good tools and good programming languages can assist much. Give Rust a try!

  

2. [Compounding Knowledge](https://fs.blog/2019/02/compounding-knowledge/)

A very cool technique to resolve git merge conflicts in vim using vim-fugitive and good shortcuts

  

4. [A brief history of Erlang and Elixir](https://www.welcometothejungle.co/articles/history-erlang-elixir)

I think this is one of the most inspiring stories in the history of Software.

Who would think that Erlang, developed in the '80s for the telecommunication industry in Ericsson

will serve so well high-scale internet systems 30 years after?

If you're a Mac user, go over the list. You'll probably find something useful

  

7. [Git History](https://githistory.xyz/)

A cool extension for traversing a file evolution in a GitHub/GitLab

  

8. [How Does Mozilla Firefox Make Money?](https://howdoesitmakemoney.com/how-does-mozilla-firefox-make-money/)

This article goes over different businesses models of Mozzila over time.

It's unintuitive that Mozilla makes money thanks to other browsers

  

9. [Funny: Windows 95 Launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAkuJXGldrM)

Just watch these 24 seconds

  

10. [Recommended Book: Programming Rust](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development/dp/1491927283)

If you want to learn Rust, then I highly recommend this book.

  

It's a more advanced book than the official [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book

so you may want to that first

  

  

"There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies."
