1. [Spacemesh smart contracts research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcvBXQ0SWJM)

My talk about the research so far at [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io/) regarding Smart Contracts leveraging WebAssembly.

  

And [here is a link to all the talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5BszCNLCnMOt7wCU9CmTaaFPP3-cIKmR) given at the _Wasm on the blockchain workshop Berlin 2019_

  

2. [The importance of unlearning](https://medium.com/@yaronwittenstein/the-importance-of-unlearning-8a96874501e5)

I'm thinking about starting my own blog...  
So this is my very first blog post about why I think it's important to stay open-minded for new technological opportunities.

  

Many thanks for [Omer Hamerman](https://medium.com/@omerxx) and [Yuval Zalmenson](https://medium.com/@zalmenson.yuval) for the feedback!

  

3. [Waxosuit - The Cloud-Native Exosuit for WebAssembly](https://waxosuit.io/)  

On the last issue, we had Fastly's announcement article about Lucet:

_[Announcing Lucet: Fastly’s native WebAssembly compiler and runtime](https://www.fastly.com/blog/announcing-lucet-fastly-native-webassembly-compiler-runtime) _

The wasm out of the browser explodes and now a new (still in its infancy) project called [Waxosuit](https://waxosuit.io/) has been born.

  

Waxosuit is a WebAssembly runtime (build on top of [wasmer](https://wasmer.io/)) for running in the cloud wasm code. 

If I understand right, the vision is to equip the Waxosuit runtime with many capabilities (plugins) that could be used by the hosted wasm programs.

  

The big vision is to make the developer more productive since he/she will have a rich set of capabilities out of the box in the wasm runtime.

(for example, logging, monitoring, database integrations...)

  

It means a developer can write less code and rely on the set of these capabilities (high-level "system-calls like") 

  

This could have the potential to be the next generation of Heroku or next generation of serverless computing

  

Here is a medium post, [Introducing Waxosuit](https://medium.com/@KevinHoffman/introducing-waxosuit-6ad754b48ed9) by [@Kevin Hoffman](https://medium.com/@KevinHoffman) the creator of waxosuit

  

4. [The Future of Programming is Dependent Types](https://medium.com/background-thread/the-future-of-programming-is-dependent-types-programming-word-of-the-day-fcd5f2634878)

A very interesting article about the future of programming using dependent types

I hope that Rust will have some form of this in the future ![](https://ssl.gstatic.com/mail/emoji/v7/png48/emoji_u1f64f.png)

  

5. [The Complete Guide to Memory (Scott H Young)](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/02/15/memory/)

This is more like a mini-book about long-term memory.

It's a joyful read full with illustrations and simple explanations.

  

One of the topics covered for better long-term memory is by practicing using

the [spaced-repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) technique. A few years ago I've given a lightning talk about this technique, [here is a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAltVK7aMEw) (the talk is in Hebrew)

  

6. [Working Memory: A Complete Guide to How Your Brain Processes Information, Thinks and Learns (Scott H Young)](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/04/24/working-memory/)

This is another mini-book about memory but this time on working memory.

If you liked the content of the above item about long-term memory, you'll surely love this one as well.

  

7. [Dual N-back Cognitive Training Improves Working Memory](https://reliawire.com/dual-n-back-memory/)

An article that reviews the positive effects of practicing the Dual N-back game on working memory (according to a conducted research)

  

8. [Former npm, Inc. CTO Announces Entropic, a Decentralized Package Registry](https://wptavern.com/former-npm-inc-cto-announces-entropic-a-decentralized-package-registry)

Last time we had GitHub Package registry and now the former CTO of npm releases a Decentralized Package Registry called Entropic. 

  

This declaration is of high importance since it's a decentralized package registry.

Did it ever happen to you that the deployment of your service failed since your centralized package manager has been down? ![](https://ssl.gstatic.com/mail/emoji/v7/png48/emoji_u1f622.png)

  

9. [Navigating code on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/navigating-code-on-github)

In the previous newsletter issue, I've added an item for [Sourcegraph](http://sourcegraph.com/) and GitHub has just released (still in Beta) its own Sourcegraph competitor (if to be delicate) and it'll be probably given the company another boost against the competition with GitLab.

  

Another product that should be worried for its future is [Octotree](https://www.octotree.io/) (browser extension on top of GitHub)

  

[GitHub also acquired another company called Pull Panda](https://github.blog/2019-06-17-github-acquires-pull-panda/) for streamlining the code reviews process

  

10. [John Fremlin's blog: How B players hire C players](http://john.freml.in/how-b-players-hire-c-players)

An eye-opening article about the nature of hiring people claiming that A Players will hire A Players, but B players will hire C players and so on.

  

I tend to agree with this. Usually, strong people will want to work with other strong people, since they understand they have something new to learn from them

(since no one knows everything).

  

This term has been coined by late Steve Jobs and here [is the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89T8VUeX9HU) to the original video of him talking about this.
